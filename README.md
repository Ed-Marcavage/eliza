1. `NEAR_ENV`: This environment variable is used to set the environment for the NEAR protocol.
2. `REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV`: This environment variable is used in the React application for the reference SDK environment.
3. `NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY`: This environment variable stores the secret key for the NEAR wallet.
4. `NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY`: This environment variable stores the public key for the NEAR wallet.
5. `NEAR_ADDRESS`: This environment variable is used to set the NEAR address.
6. `SLIPPAGE`: This environment variable is used to set the slippage value.
7. `RPC_URL`: This environment variable is used to set the RPC URL.
8. `NEAR_NETWORK`: This environment variable sets the network ID for NEAR protocol.

## Example .env File

```

Please ensure this .env file is set in the .gitignore file to avoid committing sensitive information to the repository. Configuration can be done in the .env file according to the purpose of each environment variable.

## Features

### Actions
### [action name - found in the name: EXECUTE_SWAP_NEAR]

Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.

#### Properties
- Name: EXECUTE_SWAP_NEAR
- Similes: ["SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR", "TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR", "TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR", "EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR"]

#### Handler
The handler executes a token swap using Ref Finance by connecting to the NEAR blockchain, validating parameters, and executing the swap transactions.

#### Examples
- user: "example user request"
- agent: "example agent response"

### [action name - found in the name: transfer]

Transfers NEAR tokens to another account

#### Properties
- Name: transfer
- Similes: ["TRANSFER_NEAR", "SEND_TOKENS", "TRANSFER_TOKENS", "PAY_NEAR"]

#### Handler
The handler for this action transfers NEAR tokens to another account based on the provided recipient and amount.

#### Examples
- user: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"
- agent: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now..."
- agent: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"



### Providers
### WalletProvider
This provider allows fetching and formatting wallet information including token balances and market prices.

#### Methods
Focus on the get() method and its functionality.

#### Usage
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime, Memory, Provider, State } from "@elizaos/core";
import { walletProvider } from "./providers/wallet";

const accountId = "near_account_id";

const result = await walletProvider.get({
  getSetting: (setting: string) => {
    if (setting === "NEAR_ADDRESS") {
      return accountId;
    }
    throw new Error("Setting not found");
  }
}, {}, {});

console.log(result);
```  



### Evaluators
No evaluators documentation available.

## Usage Examples
### providers/wallet.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Creating a WalletProvider instance and connecting to a NEAR protocol:
```typescript
import { WalletProvider } from './providers/wallet';

const walletProvider = new WalletProvider();
const nearAccount = await walletProvider.connect(runtime);
```

2. Fetching and formatting the portfolio value:
```typescript
import { WalletProvider } from './providers/wallet';

const walletProvider = new WalletProvider();
const formattedPortfolio = await walletProvider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
console.log(formattedPortfolio);
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure that NEAR wallet credentials are properly configured before connecting to the NEAR protocol.
- Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance when fetching portfolio data.

### actions/transfer.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Performing a NEAR token transfer to another account:
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime } from 'path/to/runtime';
import { transferNEAR } from 'path/to/transfer';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime;
const recipient = 'receiver.near';
const amount = '10';
transferNEAR(runtime, recipient, amount)
    .then((txHash) => {
        console.log(`Transfer successful. Transaction hash: ${txHash}`);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        console.error(`Error transferring NEAR tokens: ${err.message}`);
    });
```

2. Checking if a given content is a TransferContent object:
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime } from 'path/to/runtime';
import { isTransferContent } from 'path/to/transfer';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime;
const content = {
    recipient: 'receiver.near',
    amount: '10',
    tokenAddress: 'token.address'
};

if (isTransferContent(runtime, content)) {
    console.log('Content is a TransferContent object.');
} else {
    console.log('Content is not a TransferContent object.');
}
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure to handle errors appropriately in the promise chain when using `transferNEAR` to catch any exceptions that might occur during the token transfer operation.
- Validate the content before using the `isTransferContent` function to ensure that it contains the necessary properties defined in the TransferContent interface.

### environment.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. **Get Configuration Object**: You can use the `getConfig` function to get the configuration object based on the provided environment or fallback to environment variables.
   
   ```typescript
   import { getConfig } from './environment';

   const configuration = getConfig('production');
   console.log(configuration);
   ```

2. **Validate Near Configuration**: Use the `validateNearConfig` function to validate the Near configuration based on the provided runtime and environment settings.

   ```typescript
   import { validateNearConfig } from './environment';

   const runtime = { /* your runtime settings */ };
   validateNearConfig(runtime)
     .then((validatedConfig) => {
       console.log('Validation successful:', validatedConfig);
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error('Validation failed:', error);
     });
   ```

### Best Practices
- **Document your configuration settings**: Ensure you document all the required environment variables and configurations to avoid confusion for other developers using your codebase.
- **Handle fallback gracefully**: When using the `getConfig` function, make sure to handle cases where no environment is provided or no environment variables are set by gracefully falling back to default values or providing clear error messages for configuration.

### actions/swap.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Using `checkStorageBalance` to check the storage balance of an account in a contract before performing any storage-related operations.
```typescript
const account = new Account();
const contractId = "exampleContract";
checkStorageBalance(account, contractId)
    .then((hasBalance) => {
        if (hasBalance) {
            // Proceed with storage operation
        } else {
            // Handle case where storage balance is insufficient
        }
    });
```

2. Using `swapToken` to swap tokens on the NEAR protocol based on specified input and output tokens, amount, and slippage tolerance.
```typescript
const runtime = new AgentRuntime();
const inputTokenId = "near";
const outputTokenId = "dai";
const amount = "10";
const slippageTolerance = 0.05; // Higher slippage tolerance of 5%
swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance)
    .then((transactions) => {
        // Execute the transactions for the token swap
    });
```

### Best Practices
- Always handle the promises returned by the functions to properly manage the asynchronous behavior and errors.
- Provide meaningful error handling and user feedback when using these functions to ensure smooth interaction with the NEAR protocol.

## Development

### TODO Items
### Items
1. TODO: add functionality to support multiple networks
   - Context: Function `swapToken` for swapping tokens
   - Type: feature

### Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
1. Missing NEAR Wallet Credentials
   - Cause: NEAR wallet credentials are not configured or provided.
   - Solution: Ensure that the NEAR wallet secret key and public key are properly configured in the runtime settings.

### Debugging Tips
- Check the NEAR wallet credentials configuration in the runtime settings.
- Verify that the NEAR wallet secret key and public key are correctly provided.

### FAQ
Q: How to connect to NEAR protocol using the provided agent runtime?
A: You can connect to NEAR protocol by calling the `connect` method in the `WalletProvider` class with the desired network settings and key store setup. Here is an example:
   ```javascript
   const nearConnection = await connect({
            networkId: PROVIDER_CONFIG.networkId,
            keyStore: this.keyStore,
            nodeUrl: PROVIDER_CONFIG.nodeUrl,
            walletUrl: PROVIDER_CONFIG.walletUrl,
            helperUrl: PROVIDER_CONFIG.helperUrl,
        });
    ```
