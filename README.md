## Features

### Actions
### Action Name
Swap Token

#### Properties
- Name: swapToken
- Similes: SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR, TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR, TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR, EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR

#### Handler
Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.

#### Examples
- User 1:
    {
        inputTokenId: "wrap.testnet",
        outputTokenId: "ref.fakes.testnet",
        amount: "1.0",
    }
- User 2:
    {
        text: "Swapping 1.0 NEAR for REF...",
        action: "TOKEN_SWAP",
    }
- User 2:
    {
        text: "Swap completed successfully! Transaction hash: ...",
    }

### Transfer NEAR Tokens
Transfer NEAR tokens to another account

#### Properties
- Name: SEND_NEAR
- Similes: TRANSFER_NEAR, SEND_TOKENS, TRANSFER_TOKENS, PAY_NEAR

#### Handler
The handler for this action processes a request to transfer NEAR tokens to another account. It extracts the recipient address, the amount to transfer, and the optional token contract address if the transfer is not native NEAR tokens. It then validates the content and executes the transfer using the specified NEAR wallet credentials.

#### Examples
- User 1: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"
- Agent: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now..."
- Agent: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"



### Providers
### Wallet Provider
This provider allows users to fetch and format wallet information, including token balances, total value, and market prices.

#### Methods
Focus on the get() method and its functionality.

#### Usage
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime, Memory, Provider, State } from "@elizaos/core";
import { walletProvider } from "./providers/wallet";

const accountId = "exampleAccountId";
const runtime: IAgentRuntime = {
    getSetting: (key: string) => "exampleSetting",
    character: { system: "exampleSystem" },
};

const message: Memory = { content: "exampleContent" };
const state: State = { data: "exampleData" };

walletProvider.get(runtime, message, state);
```

### Common Use Cases

1. Asynchronously fetch and format wallet portfolio using a specified agent runtime:
```
const wallet = new WalletProvider(accountId);
const runtime = new IAgentRuntime();
const formattedPortfolio = await wallet.get(runtime, _message, _state);
```

2. Connect to NEAR blockchain using wallet credentials:
```
const wallet = new WalletProvider(accountId);
const runtime = new IAgentRuntime();
const connectedAccount = await wallet.connect(runtime);
```

### Best Practices

- Ensure NEAR wallet credentials are configured before attempting to connect to the NEAR blockchain.
- Implement proper error handling for fetching portfolio data and NEAR token price.

### actions/transfer.ts

### Components
- Interfaces:
  - TransferContent: Interface for transferring content.

### Common Use Cases
1. Checking if content is TransferContent:
```typescript
const isTransfer = isTransferContent(runtime, content);
console.log(isTransfer);
```

2. Transferring NEAR tokens:
```typescript
const txHash = await transferNEAR(runtime, 'recipient_account', '10');
console.log(txHash);
```

### Best Practices
- Always check if the content is of type TransferContent before performing any transfer actions.
- Make sure NEAR wallet credentials are properly configured before initiating any transfers.

### Components
Types:

- NearConfig: Represents the configuration for near environment.

Functions:

- getConfig: Get configuration based on provided environment or default environment variables.
- validateNearConfig: Validate the NEAR configuration based on the provided runtime settings and environment variables.

### Common Use Cases
1. Retrieving configuration based on environment:
```javascript
const config = getConfig('development');
console.log(config);
```

2. Validating NEAR configuration:
```javascript
const runtime = { getSetting: () => 'near.testnet' };
validateNearConfig(runtime).then(config => {
  console.log(config);
});
```

### Best Practices
- Always provide a valid environment when using `getConfig` function.
- Ensure to pass the correct runtime settings when validating NEAR configuration.

### actions/swap.ts

### Components
Functions:

- checkStorageBalance: Asynchronously checks the storage balance of a specific account within a specified contract.

- swapToken: Swap tokens between input and output token IDs with a specified amount and slippage tolerance.

### Common Use Cases
1. Checking storage balance:
```typescript
const isValid = await checkStorageBalance(account, contractId);
console.log(isValid ? "Storage balance is valid" : "Storage balance is not valid");
```

2. Swapping tokens:
```typescript
const transactions = await swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance);
console.log("Token swap transactions:", transactions);
```

### Best Practices
- Always handle the promise returned by the functions to capture the result or handle any errors.
- Ensure that the inputs provided to the functions are valid and within the allowed limits to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
1. Wallet not connecting
   - Cause: NEAR wallet credentials not configured
   - Solution: Make sure NEAR wallet credentials (NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY and NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY) are correctly configured.

### Debugging Tips
- Ensure that NEAR wallet credentials are set correctly in the runtime settings.
- Check for any errors in the wallet provider methods and debug accordingly.

### FAQ
Q: What is the purpose of the WalletProvider class?
A: The WalletProvider class is used for fetching and formatting wallet portfolio information. It connects to the NEAR blockchain using wallet credentials and retrieves the account's portfolio value.
