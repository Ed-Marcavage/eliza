## Configuration
# Environment Variable Configuration Documentation

To configure the application, you will need to set the following environment variables in a .env file. Make sure to include the required variables listed below along with their purpose:

1. **NEAR_ENV**: Specifies the environment for NEAR.
2. **REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV**: Specifies the environment for the React app reference SDK.
3. **NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY**: Secret key for the NEAR wallet.
4. **NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY**: Public key for the NEAR wallet.
5. **NEAR_ADDRESS**: NEAR address used by the runtime.
6. **SLIPPAGE**: Slippage setting for the runtime.
7. **RPC_URL**: RPC URL for the runtime.
8. **NEAR_NETWORK**: NEAR network identifier.
   
Below is an example of how the .env file should look like:

```plaintext
NEAR_ENV= 
REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV=
NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY=
NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY=
NEAR_ADDRESS=
SLIPPAGE=
RPC_URL=
NEAR_NETWORK=testnet
```

Please ensure that the .env file is included in the .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to the repository. The application will read these environment variables during runtime to customize its behavior accordingly.

## Features

### Actions
### EXECUTE_SWAP_NEAR
Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.

#### Properties
- Name: EXECUTE_SWAP_NEAR
- Similes: 
  - SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR
  - TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR
  - TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR
  - EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR

#### Handler
The handler for this action executes a token swap using Ref Finance. It validates the message, composes the state, gets wallet information, generates the swap context, and executes the token swap based on the input parameters.

#### Examples
- User 1:
    - Input Token ID: wrap.testnet
    - Output Token ID: ref.fakes.testnet
    - Amount: 1.0
- Agent:
    - Text: "Swapping 1.0 NEAR for REF..."
    - Action: TOKEN_SWAP
- Agent:
    - Text: "Swap completed successfully! Transaction hash: ..."

### SEND_NEAR
Transfer NEAR tokens to another account

#### Properties
- Name: SEND_NEAR
- Similes: TRANSFER_NEAR, SEND_TOKENS, TRANSFER_TOKENS, PAY_NEAR

#### Handler
The handler for this action executes the transfer of NEAR tokens to another account. It validates the transfer content, composes the transfer context, generates the transfer content, and then initiates the transfer. If successful, it returns a message confirming the transfer and the transaction hash. If there is an error during the transfer, it returns an error message.

#### Examples
- User1: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"
- Agent: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now..."
- Agent: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"



### Providers
### WalletProvider
The WalletProvider is a provider that allows users to fetch and display their wallet portfolio information, including token balances and market prices.

#### Methods
The `get()` method in the WalletProvider class is responsible for fetching the user's wallet portfolio information and formatting it for display.

#### Usage
```typescript
import { WalletProvider } from "./providers/wallet";

const accountId = "example_account_id";
const provider = new WalletProvider(accountId);
const portfolio = await provider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
console.log(portfolio);
```



### Evaluators
No evaluators documentation available.

## Usage Examples
### providers/wallet.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Fetching portfolio information and formatting it for display:
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider();
const runtime = {} as IAgentRuntime;

walletProvider.fetchPortfolioValue(runtime)
  .then((portfolio: WalletPortfolio) => {
    const formattedPortfolio = walletProvider.formatPortfolio(runtime, portfolio);
    console.log(formattedPortfolio);
  })
  .catch((error: Error) => {
    console.error(error.message);
  });
```

2. Connecting to the NEAR blockchain and retrieving the NEAR account:
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider();
const runtime = {} as IAgentRuntime;

walletProvider.connect(runtime)
  .then((nearAccount: Promise<nearAPI.Account>) => {
    console.log("Connected to NEAR account:", nearAccount);
  })
  .catch((error: Error) => {
    console.error(error.message);
  });
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure that NEAR wallet credentials are properly configured before calling the connect method.
- Handle errors gracefully in promise chains to provide better user feedback.

### actions/transfer.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Transfer NEAR tokens to another account:
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime } from 'near-sdk-as';
import { TransferContent, isTransferContent, transferNEAR } from './actions/transfer';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime = ...; // Initialize the runtime

const transferData: TransferContent = {
  recipient: 'example.near',
  amount: '1000000000000000000000000', // 1 NEAR in yoctoNEAR
};

if (isTransferContent(runtime, transferData)) {
  transferNEAR(runtime, transferData.recipient, transferData.amount)
    .then((txHash: string) => {
      console.log(`Transfer successful. Transaction hash: ${txHash}`);
    })
    .catch((error: Error) => {
      console.error(`Error transferring NEAR: ${error.message}`);
    });
}
```

2. Verify if content is of type TransferContent:
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime } from 'near-sdk-as';
import { TransferContent, isTransferContent } from './actions/transfer';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime = ...; // Initialize the runtime

const contentToCheck: TransferContent = {
  recipient: 'example.near',
  amount: '1000000000000000000000000', // 1 NEAR in yoctoNEAR
};

if (isTransferContent(runtime, contentToCheck)) {
  console.log('Content is of type TransferContent');
} else {
  console.log('Content is not of type TransferContent');
}
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure to properly configure NEAR wallet credentials before using `transferNEAR` function.
- Always check if the content meets the criteria to be considered as `TransferContent` using `isTransferContent` function before performing any transfer actions.

### environment.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. **Retrieving Configuration Object:** Users can use the `getConfig` function to retrieve a configuration object based on the provided environment variable. If the environment variable is not provided, it falls back to predefined values or defaults to 'testnet'.
```typescript
import { getConfig } from './environment';

const config = getConfig('mainnet');
console.log(config);
```

2. **Validating Near Configuration:** Developers can use the `validateNearConfig` function to validate a Near configuration object based on the provided runtime.
```typescript
import { validateNearConfig } from './environment';

const runtime = { networkId: 'mainnet', nodeUrl: 'https://example.com' };
validateNearConfig(runtime)
  .then((validatedConfig) => {
    console.log(validatedConfig);
  });
```

### Best Practices
- **Ensure Environment Variables:** It is recommended to ensure that the required environment variables are set before using the functions in `environment.ts`.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any errors that may occur during the configuration retrieval or validation process.

### actions/swap.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Check the storage balance of an account for a specific contract:
```typescript
const account = "alice.testnet";
const contractId = "contract.testnet";
checkStorageBalance(account, contractId)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(`Storage balance for ${account} on ${contractId}: ${result}`);
  });
```

2. Swap tokens on NEAR Protocol:
```typescript
const runtime = new AgentRuntime();
const inputTokenId = "token1";
const outputTokenId = "token2";
const amount = "10";
const slippageTolerance = 0.01;

swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance)
  .then((transactions) => {
    console.log("Swap transactions: ", transactions);
  });
```

### Best Practices
- Always handle the Promise rejections by catching errors using `.catch()` to avoid unhandled promise rejections.
- Use appropriate error handling and logging techniques to debug any issues that may arise during execution.
