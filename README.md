            ## Provider: WalletProvider

### Description:
This provider retrieves information about a NEAR wallet account and formats it into a readable portfolio report.

### Methods:

#### `get()`

- **Description:** This method retrieves the formatted portfolio information for the NEAR wallet account.
- **Parameters:**
  - `runtime`: An instance of `IAgentRuntime` interface.
  - `_message`: Not used in this method.
  - `_state`: Not used in this method.
- **Returns:** A promise that resolves to a formatted portfolio report string or null in case of an error.
- **Usage:**
  ```typescript
    const accountId = runtime.getSetting("NEAR_ADDRESS");
    if (!accountId) {
        throw new Error("NEAR_ADDRESS not configured");
    }
    const provider = new WalletProvider(accountId);
    return await provider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
  ```

### Usage Example:
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime } from "@elizaos/core";
import { walletProvider } from "./WalletProvider";

const runtime: IAgentRuntime = // initialize the runtime object with required configurations

walletProvider.get(runtime, null, null)
    .then((portfolioReport: string | null) => {
        if (portfolioReport) {
            console.log(portfolioReport);
        } else {
            console.log("Error fetching wallet information");
        }
    })
    .catch((error: Error) => {
        console.error("Error in wallet provider:", error);
    });
```


            
            ### providers/wallet.ts

# Wallet Provider

The `wallet.ts` file contains a class `WalletProvider` that implements the Provider interface, along with methods for managing wallet functionality. It includes methods for retrieving portfolio information, connecting to the NEAR blockchain, fetching data with retry logic, and formatting portfolio data.

## Purpose of Components
- **WalletProvider:** Represents a Wallet Provider that interacts with the NEAR blockchain and manages wallet functionality.
- **Interface NearToken:** Represents a token in the NEAR protocol with various attributes.
- **Interface WalletPortfolio:** Represents a wallet portfolio including total USD value, total NEAR value, and an array of NearToken objects.

## Common Use Cases

### Connect to NEAR Blockchain
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider();
const account = await walletProvider.connect(runtime);
```

### Fetch Portfolio Value
```typescript
const portfolio = await walletProvider.fetchPortfolioValue(runtime);
```

### Format Portfolio
```typescript
const formattedPortfolio = walletProvider.formatPortfolio(runtime, portfolio);
```

## Best Practices for Usage
- Ensure to provide the required parameters when calling methods to avoid errors.
- Use the provided interfaces `NearToken` and `WalletPortfolio` to create consistent data structures.
- Handle errors gracefully when fetching data from external APIs.
- Utilize caching mechanisms when fetching data that may be requested frequently to improve performance.

### actions/transfer.ts

# actions/transfer.ts Usage Documentation

## Purpose

The file `actions/transfer.ts` contains interfaces and functions related to transferring content and NEAR tokens within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. It provides a way to define and check transfer content interfaces and execute transfers of NEAR tokens to recipients.

## Common Use Cases

### Checking Transfer Content

```typescript
import { isTransferContent } from './actions/transfer';

const transferContent = {
  recipient: 'recipient.near',
  amount: 10,
};

if (isTransferContent(runtime, transferContent)) {
  // Content is valid TransferContent
} else {
  // Content is not a valid TransferContent
}
```

### Transferring NEAR Tokens

```typescript
import { transferNEAR } from './actions/transfer';

const recipient = 'recipient.near';
const amount = '10';

const txHash = await transferNEAR(runtime, recipient, amount);
console.log('Transfer successful. Transaction Hash:', txHash);
```

## Best Practices for Usage

- **Define TransferContent Interface**: When creating transfer content, ensure it follows the `TransferContent` interface to maintain consistency.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors appropriately when using `transferNEAR` function, especially when wallet credentials are not configured.
- **Input Validation**: Validate recipient address and amount before performing token transfers to prevent unexpected behavior.

By following these best practices, you can effectively transfer content and NEAR tokens while maintaining security and reliability within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem.

### environment.ts

## environment.ts

### Purpose
The `environment.ts` file contains types and functions related to the configuration of the Near blockchain environment. It provides a way to get, validate, and work with the Near configuration based on the provided runtime environment.

### Common Use Cases
#### 1. Get configuration based on environment
```typescript
import { getConfig } from './environment';

const env = 'development'; // Use the desired environment
const config = getConfig(env);
console.log(config); // Output: The configuration object based on the 'development' environment
```

#### 2. Validate and retrieve Near configuration
```typescript
import { validateNearConfig } from './environment';
import { IAgentRuntime } from './types';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime = /* provide the runtime interface */;
validateNearConfig(runtime)
  .then((nearConfig) => {
    console.log(nearConfig); // Output: The validated Near configuration
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.message); // Output: Error message if validation fails
  });
```

### Best Practices for Usage
- Use the `getConfig` function to easily get the configuration based on the desired environment.
- Ensure to provide a valid runtime interface when using the `validateNearConfig` function to avoid validation errors.
- Handle promise rejections when working with asynchronous operations to manage errors effectively.
- Keep the Near configuration logic centralized in the `environment.ts` file for better maintainability and organization.

### actions/swap.ts

## actions/swap.ts

### Purpose:
The `swap.ts` file contains two functions related to token swapping:
1. `checkStorageBalance`: Asynchronously checks the storage balance of a specified account within a specified contract.
2. `swapToken`: Perform a token swap using the given input token ID, output token ID, amount, and optional slippage tolerance.

### Common Use Cases:
#### 1. Checking Storage Balance:
```typescript
const account = 'exampleAccount';
const contractId = 'exampleContract';

const isNonZeroBalance = await checkStorageBalance(account, contractId);
console.log('Storage balance is not zero:', isNonZeroBalance);
```

#### 2. Token Swap:
```typescript
const runtime = getAgentRuntime();
const inputTokenId = 'inputTokenId';
const outputTokenId = 'outputTokenId';
const amount = '10'; // amount of tokens to be swapped
const slippageTolerance = 0.01; // optional, default is 0.01

const swapTransactions = await swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance);
console.log('Swap transactions:', swapTransactions);
```

### Best Practices for Usage:
1. **Error Handling**: Always handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of these functions to ensure the reliability of your application.
   
2. **Input Validation**: Validate the input parameters before calling these functions to prevent unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that the input token IDs, account IDs, and amounts are in the correct format and within valid ranges.

3. **Asynchronous Handling**: Since both functions return promises, make sure to handle them appropriately using `async/await` or `.then()` to ensure that the results are correctly captured and processed.

4. **Testing**: Test these functions thoroughly in a controlled environment before integrating them into a production system to avoid any unintended consequences or bugs.

5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear and updated documentation for these functions to facilitate easy understanding and usage by other developers working on the project. Include details about the input parameters, return types, and any potential side effects.
