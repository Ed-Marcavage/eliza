            ## Features

            ### Actions
            # Action: EXECUTE_SWAP_NEAR

Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.

## Properties:
- **Name:** EXECUTE_SWAP_NEAR
- **Similes:** SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR, TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR, TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR, EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR

## Validation:
The action validates the message and returns true.

## Handler:
The handler function performs the token swap using Ref Finance. It initializes the Ref SDK with the testnet environment, composes the state, extracts wallet information, composes the context with the swap template, generates the object, and executes the token swap. If any required parameters are missing, it sends a message asking for the input token ID, output token ID, and amount. Upon successful completion of the swap, it sends a message with the transaction hashes. If an error occurs during the swap, it sends an error message.

## Examples:
### Usage:
1. User {{user1}} wants to swap tokens:
    ```json
    {
        "inputTokenId": "wrap.testnet",
        "outputTokenId": "ref.fakes.testnet",
        "amount": "1.0"
    }
    ```
2. Agent performs the token swap:
    ```json
    {
        "user": "{{user2}}",
        "content": {
            "text": "Swapping 1.0 NEAR for REF...",
            "action": "TOKEN_SWAP"
        }
    }
    ```
3. Agent confirms successful swap:
    ```json
    {
        "user": "{{user2}}",
        "content": {
            "text": "Swap completed successfully! Transaction hash: ..."
        }
    }
    ```

## Note:
- Additional properties and functionalities for the action can be added as required.

# Action: SEND_NEAR

## Description
Transfer NEAR tokens to another account.

## Similar Actions
- TRANSFER_NEAR
- SEND_TOKENS
- TRANSFER_TOKENS
- PAY_NEAR

## Validation
This action does not have specific validation logic implemented. 

## Handler
1. Initialize or update state.
2. Compose transfer context using a pre-defined template.
3. Generate transfer content based on the context and a small model class.
4. Validate the transfer content.
5. Perform NEAR token transfer to the specified recipient.
6. If successful, provide a success message with the transaction details.
7. If an error occurs during the transfer, provide an error message.

## Examples
### Usage
1. User {{user1}}: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"
2. Agent {{user2}}: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now..."
3. Agent {{user2}}: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"

- The NEAR Protocol account ID should be configured using the `NEAR_ADDRESS` setting when using the `walletProvider` object.



            ### Evaluators
            

            ## Usage Examples
            ### providers/wallet.ts

### Components

Classes:
- WalletProvider: Class representing a wallet provider that implements the Provider interface.

Methods:
- constructor: Constructor for creating a new instance of the class. Takes a string parameter accountId.
- get: Retrieves the formatted portfolio from the wallet provider. Takes IAgentRuntime, Memory, and optional State parameters.
- connect: Connect to the NEAR network using the provided runtime and retrieve the account information. Throws an error if NEAR wallet credentials are not properly configured.
- fetchWithRetry: Fetches data from a given URL with retries in case of failure.
- fetchPortfolioValue: Fetch the current value of the portfolio by getting the account balance, converting it to NEAR and USD, fetching the NEAR price in USD, and calculating the total value in USD.
- fetchNearPrice: Asynchronously fetches the near price from the Coingecko API.
- formatPortfolio: Formats the portfolio information into a string with account ID, total value, token balances, and market prices.
- getFormattedPortfolio: Asynchronously retrieves the portfolio value using the provided IAgentRuntime instance and returns it in a formatted string.

Interfaces:
- NearToken: Interface representing a NEAR Protocol token.
- WalletPortfolio: Interface representing a wallet portfolio.

### Common Use Cases

1. Fetching the portfolio value and formatting it:
```typescript
const portfolioValue = await walletProvider.fetchPortfolioValue(runtime);
const formattedPortfolio = walletProvider.formatPortfolio(runtime, portfolioValue);
console.log(formattedPortfolio);
```

2. Connecting to the NEAR network and fetching account information:
```typescript
try {
    const nearAccount = await walletProvider.connect(runtime);
    console.log(nearAccount);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
}
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure NEAR wallet credentials are properly configured before connecting to the NEAR network.
- Implement retry logic when fetching data from external sources to handle network failures gracefully.

### actions/transfer.ts

### Components
Interfaces:
- TransferContent:
  Interface representing the content of a transfer operation.
  Extends the Content interface.
  - recipient - The recipient of the transfer.
  - amount - The amount to be transferred.
  - tokenAddress - Optional token address for non-native NEAR transfers.

Functions:
- isTransferContent:
  Checks if the specified content is of type TransferContent.
  - runtime - The runtime environment for running the function.
  - content - The content to be checked.
  Returns true if the content is of type TransferContent, false otherwise.
- transferNEAR:
  Transfer NEAR tokens from the current account to a specified recipient.
  - runtime - The runtime object for accessing settings and other runtime functions.
  - recipient - The NEAR account ID of the recipient.
  - amount - The amount of NEAR to transfer in string format.
  Returns a Promise that resolves to the transaction hash of the transfer.

### Common Use Cases
1. To check if a content is of type TransferContent:
```typescript
const runtime = getRuntime();
const content = getContent();

if (isTransferContent(runtime, content)) {
  // Content is a TransferContent
} else {
  // Content is not a TransferContent
}
```

2. To transfer NEAR tokens to a recipient:
```typescript
const runtime = getRuntime();
const recipient = 'recipient.near';
const amount = '10';

transferNEAR(runtime, recipient, amount)
  .then((transactionHash) => {
    console.log(`Transfer successful. Transaction hash: ${transactionHash}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(`Error transferring NEAR tokens: ${error}`);
  });
```

### Best Practices
- Always check if the content is of type TransferContent before performing any transfer operation.
- Ensure that the recipient's NEAR account ID and the amount to be transferred are valid and correctly formatted.
