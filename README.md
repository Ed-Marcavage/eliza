## TODO Items
**TODO: add functionality to support multiple networks**

**Context:** The current implementation only supports a single network (defined by NEAR_NETWORK and RPC_URL settings). To enhance the flexibility of the application, functionality should be added to support multiple networks. This would allow users to easily switch between different networks without modifying the code.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting
# Troubleshooting Guide for Package Dependencies and Error Handling

## Common Issues and Solutions:
1. **Issue:** Dependency version conflicts causing installation errors.
   **Solution:** Update or downgrade the package versions in the `package.json` file to resolve conflicts.

2. **Issue:** Error handling not implemented properly in methods.
   **Solution:** Make sure to handle errors using `try/catch` blocks and throw specific errors when necessary.

## Error Messages and Their Meanings:
1. **Error Message:** `Error: NEAR wallet credentials are not configured.`
   **Meaning:** The method `connect` requires NEAR wallet credentials to be configured.
  
## Debugging Tips:
- Utilize `console.log` statements to track the flow of execution and identify the source of errors.
- Consider using debugging tools like `node-inspect` to step through the code and pinpoint issues.

## Configuration Problems:
- Check if all necessary configuration settings (e.g., NEAR wallet credentials) are properly set up in the environment.

## Compatibility Issues:
Ensure that the versions of the packages in the `package.json` file are compatible with each other and with the runtime environment.

## Performance Optimization:
- Use asynchronous programming techniques to improve performance, especially in methods that involve network requests.
- Cache frequently used data to reduce unnecessary requests and improve response times.

## FAQ Section:
### Q: How to handle errors when using the `get` method?
A: You can handle errors by wrapping the method call in a `try/catch` block and returning the error message if an exception occurs.

### Q: Why am I getting a `TypeError: Cannot read property 'runtime' of undefined` error?
A: This error occurs when the `runtime` object is not properly passed to the method. Make sure to pass the correct arguments when calling the method.

### Q: How to optimize performance when connecting to the NEAR blockchain?
A: Consider using connection pooling or optimizing network requests to reduce latency and improve performance.

By following these troubleshooting steps and best practices, you can effectively address package dependencies and error handling issues in your project.
