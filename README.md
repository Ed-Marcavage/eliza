    ## Configuration
    # Configuration Documentation

## Required Environment Variables and Their Purpose
1. `NEAR_ENV`: Used to set the NEAR environment.
2. `REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV`: Used to reference the SDK environment.
3. `NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for the NEAR wallet.
4. `NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY`: Public key for the NEAR wallet.
5. `NEAR_ADDRESS`: NEAR address for the runtime or process environment.
6. `SLIPPAGE`: Slippage setting for runtime or process environment.
7. `RPC_URL`: RPC URL setting for runtime or process environment.
8. `NEAR_NETWORK`: Network ID for NEAR or default to "testnet".

## Example .env File
```plaintext
NEAR_ENV=dev
REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV=production
NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey123
NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY=mypublickey123
NEAR_ADDRESS=example.near
SLIPPAGE=1
RPC_URL=http://example.com/near
NEAR_NETWORK=mainnet
```

To configure your application, update the values of these environment variables in the `.env` file. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

    ## Features

    ### Actions
    Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.
Similes/Aliases:
- SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR
- TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR
- TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR
- EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR

The handler function of this action initializes the Ref SDK with the testnet environment, composes the state from the message, obtains wallet information, generates the swap context, and extracts the input token ID, output token ID, and amount for the requested token swap. If any of these parameters are missing, the action will notify the user and skip the swap. It then retrieves the NEAR account credentials, creates a key store, connects to NEAR, executes the token swap using the `swapToken` function, and signs and sends the transactions.

Usage Examples:
1. 
   - User1 provides input token ID as "wrap.testnet", output token ID as "ref.fakes.testnet", and amount as "1.0".
   - User2 initiates the action with the statement "Swapping 1.0 NEAR for REF...".
   - User2 receives a response indicating "Swap completed successfully! Transaction hash: ..."

Interaction Examples:
- {{user1}}: "I want to swap 1.0 WRAP tokens for REF tokens."
- {{user2}}: "Sure, initiating the swap now..."
- {{user2}}: "Swap completed successfully! Transaction hash: ..."

1. This action named "SEND_NEAR" allows transferring NEAR tokens to another account.

2. Similes/Aliases: "TRANSFER_NEAR", "SEND_TOKENS", "TRANSFER_TOKENS", "PAY_NEAR"

3. The handler function of this action initializes or updates the state, composes a transfer context using a predefined template, generates transfer content based on the context, validates the transfer content, and finally executes the NEAR transfer to the specified recipient with the specified amount. If the transfer is successful, it provides a success message with the transaction details. If there is an error during the transfer process, it logs the error and informs the user.

4. Usage Examples:
   - Natural Language Example: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet."
   - Interaction Example between {{user1}} and {{user2}}:
     - {{user1}}: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet."
     - {{user2}}: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now..."
     - {{user2}}: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"

    ### Providers
    ## WalletProvider

The `WalletProvider` class is used to fetch and format wallet information such as token balances and portfolio value based on the NEAR Protocol network. This provider requires the NEAR wallet credentials to be configured in the runtime settings.

### Constructor

#### walletProvider

- Type: Provider
- Description: A provider object that contains the `get()` method for fetching and formatting wallet information.

### Methods

#### get()

- Type: Asynchronous method
- Description: This method is responsible for fetching and formatting the wallet portfolio information. It retrieves the NEAR wallet address from the runtime settings, creates an instance of `WalletProvider`, and calls the `getFormattedPortfolio()` method to generate the portfolio report.
- Parameters:
  - `runtime`: IAgentRuntime - The interface for agent runtime that provides access to settings, state, and messaging.
  - `_message`: Memory - Not used in this method.
  - `_state`: State - Not used in this method.
- Returns:
  - Type: Promise<string | null>
  - Description: A promise that resolves to a formatted string containing the wallet information or null if an error occurs.

### Usage

To use the `WalletProvider` to get wallet information, the NEAR wallet address (NEAR_ADDRESS) must be configured in the runtime settings. Once configured, you can call the `get()` method on the `walletProvider` object to retrieve the formatted wallet portfolio information.
