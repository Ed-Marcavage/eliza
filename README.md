## Features

### Actions
### [action name - found in the name: swap]
Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.

#### Properties
- Name: swap
- Similes: ["SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR", "TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR", "TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR", "EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR"]

#### Handler
The handler executes a token swap using Ref Finance by estimating the swap route, checking storage balances, and executing the swap transactions accordingly.

#### Examples
- user: "{{user1}}"
- agent: "Respond with a JSON markdown block containing only the extracted values. Use null for any values that cannot be determined. Example response: { "inputTokenId": "wrap.testnet", "outputTokenId": "ref.fakes.testnet", "amount": "1.5" } Given the recent messages and wallet information below: {{walletInfo}} Extract the following information about the requested token swap: - Input token ID (the token being sold) - Output token ID (the token being bought) - Amount to swap Respond with a JSON markdown block containing only the extracted values. Use null for any values that cannot be determined. The result should be a valid JSON object with the following schema: { "inputTokenId": string | null, "outputTokenId": string | null, "amount": string | null }"
- user: "{{user2}}"
- agent: "Swap completed successfully! Transaction hashes: ..."

```json
{
    "inputTokenId": "wrap.testnet",
    "outputTokenId": "ref.fakes.testnet",
    "amount": "1.0"
}
```

### Transfer NEAR Tokens

#### Properties
- Name: SEND_NEAR
- Similes: ["TRANSFER_NEAR", "SEND_TOKENS", "TRANSFER_TOKENS", "PAY_NEAR"]

#### Handler
Allows the user to transfer NEAR tokens to another account.

#### Examples
- user: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"
- agent: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"



### Providers
### Wallet Provider
This provider allows you to fetch wallet information including token balances and total portfolio value.

#### Methods
Focus on the get() method and its functionality.

#### Usage
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime, Memory, Provider, State } from "@elizaos/core";
import { walletProvider } from "./providers/wallet";

const exampleGetUsage = async () => {
    const runtime: IAgentRuntime = {} as IAgentRuntime;
    const message: Memory = {} as Memory;
    const state: State = {} as State;

    const walletInfo = await walletProvider.get(runtime, message, state);
    console.log(walletInfo);
};

exampleGetUsage();
```



### Evaluators
No evaluators documentation available.

## Usage Examples
### providers/wallet.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Fetching portfolio value for a user:
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider('exampleAccountId');
const formattedPortfolio = await walletProvider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
console.log(formattedPortfolio);
```

2. Connecting to NEAR blockchain and fetching wallet portfolio value:
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider('exampleAccountId');
const nearAccount = await walletProvider.connect(runtime);
const formattedPortfolio = await walletProvider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
console.log(formattedPortfolio);
```

### Best Practices
- Use `fetchWithRetry` method for fetching resources to handle potential network failures.
- Utilize the `fetchNearPrice` method to fetch the current price of NEAR token in USD from the Coingecko API efficiently.

### actions/transfer.ts

- **Common Use Cases**
1. Check if the provided content is TransferContent:
```typescript
const isTransferContent = (runtime: IAgentRuntime, content: any): boolean => {
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

2. Transfer NEAR tokens to a recipient:
```typescript
const transferNEAR = async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, recipient: string, amount: string): Promise<string> => {
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

- **Best Practices**
- Ensure to handle errors gracefully in the `transferNEAR` function to provide clear feedback to the user in case of any issues.
- Validate the `content` parameter thoroughly in the `isTransferContent` function to prevent any unexpected behavior.

### environment.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Accessing configuration based on specified environment:
```typescript
import { getConfig } from './environment';

const config = getConfig('testnet');
console.log(config); // Output: { networkId: 'testnet', nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org', helperUrl: 'https://helper.testnet.near.org' }
```

2. Validating Near configuration settings:
```typescript
import { validateNearConfig } from './environment';

validateNearConfig(runtime)
  .then((config) => {
    console.log(config); // Output: { networkId: 'mainnet', nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.mainnet.near.org', helperUrl: 'https://helper.mainnet.near.org' }
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

### Best Practices
- Document the available environments and their corresponding network details for easy reference.
- Use the `validateNearConfig` function before using the configuration to ensure all settings are correct.

### actions/swap.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Checking the storage balance of a specific account within a smart contract:
```typescript
const account = { id: "example_account_id", balance: 100 };
const contractId = "example_contract_id";
checkStorageBalance(account, contractId).then((isNonZero) => {
  if (isNonZero) {
    console.log("Storage balance is non-zero");
  } else {
    console.log("Storage balance is zero");
  }
});
```

2. Swapping tokens on the NEAR protocol:
```typescript
const runtime = { /* agent runtime object properties */ };
const inputTokenId = "near_token";
const outputTokenId = "example_token";
const amount = "100";
const slippageTolerance = 0.01;
swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance).then((transactions) => {
  console.log("Swap successful, transactions:", transactions);
});
```

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
- Error handling should be implemented when using the Promise returned by the functions to handle any potential issues.
