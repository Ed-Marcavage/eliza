## Actions
# Action: EXECUTE_SWAP_NEAR

### Description:
Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.

### Similes:
- SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR
- TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR
- TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR
- EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR

### Validate:
- Validates the input message parameters.

### Handler:
- Handles the execution of the token swap.
- Initializes the Ref SDK with the testnet environment.
- Composes the state.
- Generates a response based on the extracted information from the message.
- Checks for missing required parameters before proceeding with the swap.
- Executes the token swap by calling the `swapToken` function.
- Signs and sends transactions to complete the swap.
- Handles successful and error scenarios with error messages.

### Examples:
#### # Usage
- User {{user1}} requests to swap 1.0 NEAR for REF token.
- Agent:
    ```
    inputTokenId: "wrap.testnet",
    outputTokenId: "ref.fakes.testnet",
    amount: "1.0"
    ```
- User {{user2}} initiates the token swap action.
- Agent responds with a success message including the transaction hash.

#### Example:
```json
[
    {
        user: "{{user1}}",
        content: {
            inputTokenId: "wrap.testnet",
            outputTokenId: "ref.fakes.testnet",
            amount: "1.0",
        },
    },
    {
        user: "{{user2}}",
        content: {
            text: "Swapping 1.0 NEAR for REF...",
            action: "TOKEN_SWAP",
        },
    },
    {
        user: "{{user2}}",
        content: {
            text: "Swap completed successfully! Transaction hash: ...",
        },
    },
]
```

## Transfer NEAR Action

### Description
Transfer NEAR tokens to another account.

### Properties
- **Name:** SEND_NEAR
- **Similes:** TRANSFER_NEAR, SEND_TOKENS, TRANSFER_TOKENS, PAY_NEAR

### Validate
This action does not have specific validation logic implemented.

### Handler
1. **State Initialization:** Initializes or updates the state with the recent message.
2. **Action Execution:**
   - Composes the transfer context using the specified template.
   - Generates transfer content using the small model class.
   - Validates the transfer content.
   - Transfers NEAR tokens to the recipient account.
   - Sends a success or error response based on the transaction status.

### Usage
{{user1}}
- Sends a message: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"

{{user2}}
- Responds with: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now..." to initiate the transfer.
- Receives a message: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ" confirming the transfer.

### Examples
```typescript
[
    [
        {
            user: "{{user1}}",
            content: {
                text: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet",
            },
        },
        {
            user: "{{user2}}",
            content: {
                text: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now...",
                action: "SEND_NEAR",
            },
        },
        {
            user: "{{user2}}",
            content: {
                text: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ",
            },
        },
    ],
] as ActionExample[][]
```


## Providers
### `get()` Method Documentation

The `get()` method in the `WalletProvider` class is responsible for retrieving the formatted portfolio information for a specified NEAR wallet account. The method takes in three parameters:

1. `runtime`: An instance of the `IAgentRuntime` interface, which provides access to settings and configurations required for interacting with the NEAR blockchain.
2. `_message`: A `Memory` object that contains any additional data or context relevant to the execution of the method (not used in this specific implementation).
3. `_state`: An optional `State` object that represents the state of the conversation or application (not used in this specific implementation).

#### Return Value:
- A `Promise` that resolves to a string containing the formatted portfolio information of the NEAR wallet account.
- If successful, the method returns the formatted portfolio information as a string.
- If an error occurs during the execution of the method, it will log the error and return `null`.

#### Usage:
```typescript
const accountId = "example.near"; // Replace with the NEAR wallet account ID
const provider = new WalletProvider(accountId);
const portfolioInfo = await provider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
console.log(portfolioInfo);
```

#### Error Handling:
If the NEAR_ADDRESS setting is not configured or if any errors occur during the execution of the method (such as fetching portfolio data or formatting the information), the method will log the error and return `null`.

#### Example:
```typescript
// Inside an async function
try {
    const accountId = runtime.getSetting("NEAR_ADDRESS");
    if (!accountId) {
        throw new Error("NEAR_ADDRESS not configured");
    }

    const provider = new WalletProvider(accountId);
    const portfolioInfo = await provider.get(runtime, new Memory(), new State());
    console.log(portfolioInfo);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in wallet provider:", error);
}
```

const accountService = new AccountService();

accountService.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime)
  .then((formattedPortfolio) => {
    console.log(formattedPortfolio);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

### Example 2: Connect to NEAR Blockchain

  .then((accountInfo) => {
    console.log(accountInfo);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

## Modifying and Extending Functionality

To modify or extend the functionality of AccountService class methods, you can create subclasses that inherit from AccountService and override the methods. For example:

```javascript
class CustomAccountService extends AccountService {
  async fetchPortfolioValueCustom(runtime) {
    // Custom implementation to fetch portfolio value
  }
}
```

By extending the AccountService class, you can customize the behavior of methods or add new functionality as needed.
