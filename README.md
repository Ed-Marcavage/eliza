## Installation Instructions

### 1. Add the plugin to your ElizaOS project:

1. Add the following to your agent/package.json dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "@elizaos/plugin-near": "workspace:*"
     }
   }
   ```

2. cd into the agent/ directory.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install the new dependency.
4. Run `pnpm build` to build the project with the new plugin.

### 2. Import and Use the Plugin:

- Import the plugin using:
  ```javascript
  import { nearPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-near";
  ```

- Add it to the AgentRuntime plugins array in your code.

### 3. Integration Example:

```typescript
import { nearPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-near";

return new AgentRuntime({
    // other configuration...
    plugins: [
        nearPlugin,
        // other plugins...
    ],
});
```

### 4. Verification Steps:

Ensure successful integration by checking for the following message in the console:
```
âœ“ Registering action: <plugin actions>
```

Make sure to have the required peer dependencies installed in your project as well.

## Configuration
# Configuration Documentation

## Required Environment Variables and Their Purpose

1. `NEAR_ENV`: Used as a fallback value if `NEAR_ENV` is not provided in the environment.
2. `REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV`: Environment variable for setting the reference SDK environment.
3. `NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Near wallet.
4. `NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY`: Public key for Near wallet.
5. `NEAR_ADDRESS`: NEAR address used for runtime settings.
6. `SLIPPAGE`: Slippage setting for runtime or from environment variable `SLIPPAGE`.
7. `RPC_URL`: RPC URL setting for blockchain interactions.
8. `NEAR_NETWORK`: Network ID for NEAR network, defaults to "testnet".
  
## Example .env File

```plaintext
NEAR_ENV=
REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV=
NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY=
NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY=
NEAR_ADDRESS=
SLIPPAGE=
RPC_URL=
NEAR_NETWORK=
```  

Please make sure to configure these environment variables in the .env file. Ensure that the .env file is added to the .gitignore to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

## Features

### Actions
No actions documentation available.

### Providers
### Wallet Provider
This provider allows users to fetch and display NEAR wallet information.

#### Methods
Focus on the get() method and its functionality.

#### Usage
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime, Memory, Provider, State } from "@elizaos/core";
import { walletProvider } from "./providers/wallet";

const runtime: IAgentRuntime;
const message: Memory;
const state: State;

const result = await walletProvider.get(runtime, message, state);
console.log(result);
```



### Evaluators
No evaluators documentation available.

## Usage Examples
### providers/wallet.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Create a new instance of the WalletProvider class and connect to a NEAR wallet using the provided runtime.
```javascript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider("myAccountId");
const account = await walletProvider.connect(runtime);
```

2. Fetch the current portfolio value and retrieve the formatted portfolio information.
```javascript
const formattedPortfolio = await walletProvider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
console.log(formattedPortfolio);
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure to handle errors gracefully when fetching data from external APIs to avoid application crashes.
- Utilize caching mechanisms to store and retrieve data efficiently for improved performance.

### actions/transfer.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. **Transfer NEAR tokens:** Transfer NEAR tokens from one NEAR account to another.
   ```typescript
   import { transferNEAR } from './actions/transfer';

   const recipient = 'recipient.near';
   const amount = '10';
   transferNEAR(runtime, recipient, amount)
     .then((transactionHash) => {
       console.log(`Transfer successful. Transaction Hash: ${transactionHash}`);
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error.message);
     });
   ```

2. **Check if content is TransferContent:** Validate if the provided content is a TransferContent object.
   ```typescript
   import { isTransferContent } from './actions/transfer';

   const content = {
     recipient: 'recipient.near',
     amount: '10',
     tokenAddress: 'token.near'
   };

   const isTransfer = isTransferContent(runtime, content);
   if (isTransfer) {
     console.log('Content is a valid TransferContent object');
   } else {
     console.log('Content is not a TransferContent object');
   }
   ```

### Best Practices
- **Validate Content:** Always validate the content using `isTransferContent` function before performing a transfer to ensure data integrity.
- **Handle Errors:** Use `.catch` block to handle any errors that may occur during the transfer process to provide appropriate feedback to the user.

### environment.ts

- First use case with code example:
```typescript
import { getConfig } from 'environment';

const config = getConfig('production');
console.log(config);
```

- Second use case with code example:
```typescript
import { validateNearConfig } from 'environment';
import { IAgentRuntime } from 'types';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime = {
  env: 'production',
  app_id: 'myapp',
  api_key: 'myapikey'
};
const validatedConfig = await validateNearConfig(runtime);
console.log(validatedConfig);
```

- Best practice 1:
Make sure to provide a valid environment parameter when using the getConfig function to retrieve the configuration object.

- Best practice 2:
Ensure that the runtime object passed to validateNearConfig includes all the necessary properties for validating the Near configuration.

### actions/swap.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Checking the storage balance of a specific account:
```typescript
const account = { address: "0x1234567890" };
const contractId = "0xabcdef";
const hasBalance = await checkStorageBalance(account, contractId);
console.log(hasBalance); // true or false
```

2. Performing a token swap transaction:
```typescript
const runtime = { /* agent runtime object */ };
const inputTokenId = "0x123456";
const outputTokenId = "0xabcdef";
const amount = "100";
const slippageTolerance = 0.01;
const transactions = await swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance);
console.log(transactions); // array of transactions
```

### Best Practices
- When calling `checkStorageBalance`, ensure that the `account` object contains a valid address and the `contractId` is the correct contract ID.
- When calling `swapToken`, make sure to provide the necessary parameters such as `runtime`, `inputTokenId`, `outputTokenId`, `amount`, and optionally `slippageTolerance` for a smooth token swap transaction.

## Development

### TODO Items
### Items
1. TODO: add functionality to support multiple networks
   - Context: Function `swapToken` needs to be updated to support multiple networks for swapping tokens.
   - Type: enhancement

### Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
1. Issue: NEAR wallet credentials not configured
   - Cause: The NEAR wallet credentials are missing or not properly configured in the runtime settings.
   - Solution: Ensure that the NEAR wallet secret key and public key are set correctly in the runtime settings.

### Debugging Tips
- Check the NEAR wallet credentials configuration in the runtime settings.
- Verify that the NEAR wallet secret key and public key are correctly set before executing any wallet-related functions.

### FAQ
Q: How can I check if the NEAR wallet credentials are configured properly?
A: You can verify the NEAR wallet credentials by checking the runtime settings for the NEAR wallet secret key and public key. Make sure they are set correctly to connect to the NEAR wallet successfully.
