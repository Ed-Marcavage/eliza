## Usage Examples
# WalletProvider Class

WalletProvider class implements the Provider interface and manages wallet functionality such as connecting to NEAR wallet, fetching portfolio value, and formatting portfolio data.

## Constructor
```javascript
/**
 * Constructor for creating a new instance of the class.
 * @param {string} accountId - The unique identifier for the account.
 */
```

## Methods

### get
```javascript
/**
 * Retrieves the formatted portfolio using the specified runtime.
 * 
 * @param {IAgentRuntime} runtime - The runtime to use for the operation.
 * @param {Memory} _message - The memory object.
 * @param {State} [_state] - Optional state object.

 *
 * @param {string} url - The URL to fetch data from.
 * @param {RequestInit} [options={}] - The options for the fetch request.
 * @returns {Promise<any>} A promise that resolves to the fetched data.
 */
```

### fetchPortfolioValue
```javascript
/**
 * Asynchronously fetches the current value of the wallet portfolio.
 * 
 * @param {IAgentRuntime} runtime - The agent runtime to use for fetching data.
 * @returns {Promise<WalletPortfolio>} A promise that resolves to the wallet portfolio value object.
 * @throws {Error} If there is an error fetching the portfolio value.
 */
```

### fetchNearPrice
```javascript
/**
 * Fetches the near price from an API, with caching mechanism to avoid unnecessary requests.
 * Returns the near price in USD.
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<number>} The near price in USD
 */
```

 */
```

## Create

### Basic Usage Example
```javascript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider('user123');
walletProvider.connect(agentRuntime)
  .then(nearAccount => {
    walletProvider.fetchPortfolioValue(agentRuntime)
      .then(portfolio => {
        const formattedPortfolio = walletProvider.formatPortfolio(agentRuntime, portfolio);
        console.log(formattedPortfolio);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching portfolio value:', error);
      });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error connecting to NEAR network:', error);
  });
```

## Modifying and Extending Functionality

To modify or extend the functionality of actions, providers, and evaluators, you can create custom methods within the WalletProvider class or extend it with additional functionalities. Here's an example of extending the WalletProvider class with a new method:

```javascript
class CustomWalletProvider extends WalletProvider {
  constructor(accountId) {
    super(accountId);
  }

  // Custom method to perform a specific action
  customAction() {
    // Add custom functionality here
  }
}
```

In this example, you can create a new instance of the CustomWalletProvider class and access the customAction method along with the existing methods provided by WalletProvider.

Remember to consider the design patterns and best practices while modifying or extending the functionality of classes to maintain code readability and scalability.

## TODO Items
**TODO Comment:** 
TODO: add functionality to support multiple networks

**Context:** 
The code currently only supports one network (testnet) and hardcoded RPC URL. The task is to modify the code to enable support for multiple networks, allowing users to specify network settings dynamically.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting
# Package Dependency Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions
- **Issue:** Package not found or dependency mismatch
  - **Solution:** Double-check the versions of the dependencies listed in the package.json file. Make sure they match the exact versions specified in the dependencies section.

## Error Messages and Their Meaning
- **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '@elizaos/core'`
  - **Meaning:** The module '@elizaos/core' is not installed or is missing in the project dependencies.
- **Error Message:** `Unhandled promise rejection. Error: There was an error fetching the portfolio value.`
  - **Meaning:** An error occurred during the portfolio value fetch operation. 
  
## Debugging Tips
- Use console.log() statements to log variables and check their values during runtime.
- Utilize the browser developer tools or a debugging tool like VS Code to step through the code and identify the source of errors.

## Configuration Problems
- Verify that all required configurations for the project, including API keys and environment variables, are correctly set up.
- Check that the paths and file names specified in the configuration files are accurate.

## Compatibility Issues
- Ensure that the versions of the dependencies listed in the package.json file are compatible with each other.
- Check for any potential conflicts between the versions of the dependencies used in the project.

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize code efficiency by reducing redundant operations and improving algorithms where possible.
- Implement caching mechanisms to store and retrieve data efficiently, especially for frequently accessed resources.

## FAQ Section
### Q: Why am I getting the error "Unhandled promise rejection" in my fetchPortfolioValue method?
A: This error indicates that there was an issue while fetching the portfolio value. Check the implementation of the fetchPortfolioValue method and ensure that error handling is correctly implemented to catch any errors that occur during the fetch operation.

### Q: How can I troubleshoot package dependency mismatches in my project?
A: Double-check the versions of the dependencies listed in the package.json file and ensure they match the exact versions specified in the dependencies section. You can also try removing the node_modules folder and running `npm install` again to reinstall the dependencies.
