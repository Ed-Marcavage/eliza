## Configuration
# Configuration Documentation

## Required Environment Variables

1. `NEAR_ENV`: Used to specify the NEAR environment.
2. `REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV`: Used in the React application for SDK environment.
3. `NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for NEAR wallet.
4. `NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY`: Public key for NEAR wallet.

REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV=production
NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
NEAR_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address
SLIPPAGE=1
RPC_URL=https://your_rpc_url

Please make sure to configure the environment variables in the `.env` file of your project. Also, ensure that the `.env` file is added to the `.gitignore` so that sensitive information is not committed to the repository.

## Features

### Actions
### Action Name: Swap

Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.

#### Properties
- Name: EXECUTE_SWAP_NEAR
- Similes: ["SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR", "TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR", "TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR", "EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR"]

#### Handler
The handler executes a token swap by connecting to the NEAR blockchain, validating the token swap request, generating the swap context, extracting required information, and signing and sending the swap transactions.

#### Examples
- user: "{{user1}}"
- agent: "{{user2}}"
- user: "{{user2}}"

### Transfer
Transfer NEAR tokens to another account

#### Properties
- Name: Transfer
- Similes: ["TRANSFER_NEAR", "SEND_TOKENS", "TRANSFER_TOKENS", "PAY_NEAR"]

#### Handler
The handler for this action transfers NEAR tokens to the recipient account specified in the message content. It validates the content, composes the transfer context, generates the transfer content, and then executes the token transfer using the `transferNEAR` function.

#### Examples
- user: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"
- agent: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now..."
- agent: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"



### Providers
### WalletProvider
This provider connects to a NEAR wallet and fetches the user's portfolio information including token balances and total value in USD.

#### Methods
Focus on the get() method and its functionality.

#### Usage
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime, Memory, Provider, State } from "@elizaos/core";
import { walletProvider } from "./providers/wallet";

const runtime: IAgentRuntime;
const message: Memory;
const state: State;

const result = await walletProvider.get(runtime, message, state);
console.log(result);
```



### Evaluators
No evaluators documentation available.

## Usage Examples
### providers/wallet.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Fetching and formatting portfolio information for a NEAR wallet:
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider("exampleAccount");
const portfolio = await walletProvider.getFormattedPortfolio(agentRuntime);
console.log(portfolio);
```

2. Connecting to NEAR blockchain and fetching portfolio value with retry mechanism:
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider("exampleAccount");
const account = await walletProvider.connect(agentRuntime);
const portfolioValue = await walletProvider.fetchPortfolioValue(agentRuntime);
console.log("Portfolio Value:", portfolioValue);
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure to handle errors gracefully by catching and handling any exceptions in the promise chain.
- Use proper error handling mechanisms like try-catch blocks while working with asynchronous operations to prevent unexpected crashes.

### actions/transfer.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Transferring NEAR tokens from one account to another:
```typescript
// Define transfer content
const transferContent: TransferContent = {
  recipient: "recipient.near",
  amount: "10",
  tokenAddress: "near"
};

// Check if transfer content is valid
const isValidTransfer = isTransferContent(runtime, transferContent);

if (isValidTransfer) {
  // Initiate transfer
  transferNEAR(runtime, transferContent.recipient, transferContent.amount)
    .then((txHash) => {
      console.log(`Transaction successful. Tx Hash: ${txHash}`);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
    });
} else {
  console.error("Invalid transfer content");
}
```

2. Validating if provided content is a transfer object:
```typescript
// Define content object
const content = {
  recipient: "recipient.near",
  amount: "10",
  tokenAddress: "near"
};

// Check if content is a transfer object
const isTransfer = isTransferContent(runtime, content);
console.log(isTransfer); // Output: true
```

### Best Practices
- Always validate the content object using `isTransferContent` before initiating a transfer to prevent any errors.
- Make sure to handle any errors thrown during the transfer process to provide meaningful feedback to the user.

### environment.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Fetching NEAR configuration based on the provided environment:
    ```typescript
    const config = getConfig('production');
    console.log(config); // Output: { networkId: 'mainnet', nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.mainnet.near.org', contractName: 'example' }
    ```

2. Validating NEAR configuration based on runtime settings:
    ```typescript
    const runtimeSettings = {
        networkId: 'testnet',
        nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org',
        contractName: 'example-contract'
    };
    
    validateNearConfig(runtimeSettings)
        .then((validatedConfig) => {
            console.log(validatedConfig); // Output: { networkId: 'testnet', nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org', contractName: 'example-contract' }
        });
    ```

### Best Practices
- Always provide the environment parameter to `getConfig` function to get configuration specific to that environment.
- Ensure to handle the resolved Promise from `validateNearConfig` function to access the validated NEAR configuration.

### actions/swap.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Checking storage balance of an account within a contract:
```typescript
const account = "example.near";
const contractId = "example-contract";
const hasStorageBalance = await checkStorageBalance(account, contractId);
console.log(hasStorageBalance); // Output: true or false
```

2. Performing a token swap operation on NEAR Protocol:
```typescript
const runtime = Runtime.create(....); // Create NEAR Protocol runtime object
const inputTokenId = "tokenA";
const outputTokenId = "tokenB";
const amount = "100";
const slippageTolerance = 0.1;
const swapResult = await swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance);
console.log(swapResult); // Output: Array of transactions for the swap operation
```

### Best Practices
- Always handle the Promise returned by the functions with `await` or `.then()` method to properly access the resolved data.
- Make sure to provide correct inputs to the functions according to the specified parameters to avoid errors.

### Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
1. The NEAR wallet credentials are not configured
   - Cause: The NEAR wallet secret key and public key are missing or not set in the runtime settings.
   - Solution: Set the NEAR wallet secret key and public key in the runtime settings to establish the connection with the NEAR blockchain.

### Debugging Tips
- Ensure the NEAR wallet secret key and public key are correctly configured in the runtime settings.
- Verify that the NEAR network ID, node URL, and wallet URL are set correctly for the connection.
