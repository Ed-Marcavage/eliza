## Installation
## Installation and Integration Instructions for @elizaos/plugin-near

### 1. Adding the plugin to your ElizaOS project:

1. Add the following to your agent/package.json dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "@elizaos/plugin-near": "workspace:*"
     }
   }
   ```

2. CD into the agent/ directory.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install the new dependency.
4. Run `pnpm build` to build the project with the new plugin.

### 2. Importing and Using the plugin:

- Import the plugin using:
  ```typescript
  import { nearPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-near";
  ```

- Add the plugin to the AgentRuntime plugins array:
  ```typescript
  return new AgentRuntime({
      // other configuration...
      plugins: [
          nearPlugin,
          // other plugins...
      ],
  });
  ```

### 3. Integration Example:

```typescript
import { nearPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-near";

return new AgentRuntime({
    // other configuration...
    plugins: [
        nearPlugin,
        // other plugins...
    ],
});
```

### 4. Verification Steps:

Ensure that you see ["âœ“ Registering action: <plugin actions>"] in the console to verify successful integration.

Remember to also ensure that the plugin dependencies and peer dependencies are installed correctly to avoid any issues during integration.

## Configuration
# Configuration Documentation

To configure the application, you will need to set the following environment variables in a `.env` file. Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

## Required Environment Variables

1. `NEAR_ENV`: Used to specify the environment for NEAR.
2. `REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV`: Used for REACT_APP_REF_SDK environment.
3. `NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY`: Used for NEAR wallet secret key.
4. `NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY`: Used for NEAR wallet public key.
5. `NEAR_ADDRESS`: Used for NEAR address.
6. `SLIPPAGE`: Used to set the slippage.
7. `RPC_URL`: Used for RPC URL.
8. `NEAR_NETWORK`: Used to specify the NEAR network.

## Example .env File

```plaintext
NEAR_ENV=
REACT_APP_REF_SDK_ENV=
NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY=
NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY=
NEAR_ADDRESS=
SLIPPAGE=
RPC_URL=
NEAR_NETWORK=
```

## Note

For some variables, default values are used if the environment variable is not set. Make sure to customize these values according to your setup.

## Features

### Actions
#### Action
- Name: swap
- Similes: ["SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR", "TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR", "TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR", "EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR"]

#### Handler
The handler for this action performs a token swap using Ref Finance. It checks the input token ID, output token ID, and amount to perform the swap. It then connects to the NEAR blockchain, executes the swap, signs and sends transactions, and returns the result.

#### Examples
- user: ["{{user1}}"]
- agent: ["Example response:\n```json\n{\n    \"inputTokenId\": \"wrap.testnet\",\n    \"outputTokenId\": \"ref.fakes.testnet\",\n    \"amount\": \"1.0\"\n}\n```"]

#### Action
- Name: transfer
- Similes: ["TRANSFER_NEAR", "SEND_TOKENS", "TRANSFER_TOKENS", "PAY_NEAR"]

#### Handler
The handler for the transfer action facilitates the transfer of NEAR tokens to another account. It retrieves the recipient address, amount to transfer, and token contract address (if applicable) from the user's request, validates the content, and executes the transfer using the NEAR protocol. It provides feedback to the user upon successful or failed transfer attempts.

#### Examples
- user: ["Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"]
- agent: ["Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"]



### Providers
### Wallet Provider
This provider allows you to fetch and format wallet information including account balance and token details.

#### Methods
Focus on the get() method and its functionality.

#### Usage
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime, Memory, State } from "@elizaos/core";
import { Provider } from "providers/wallet";

const accountId = "your_account_id";
const provider = new WalletProvider(accountId);
const result = await provider.get(runtime, memory, state);
console.log(result);
```

const runtime = { /* mock runtime object */ };
const wallet = new WalletProvider('testAccountId');
wallet.connect(runtime)
  .then((account) => {
    return wallet.fetchPortfolioValue(runtime)
      .then((portfolio) => {
        const formattedPortfolio = wallet.formatPortfolio(runtime, portfolio);
        console.log(formattedPortfolio);
      });
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.message);
  });
```

## Development

### TODO Items
1. TODO: add functionality to support multiple networks
2. The code currently only supports one network (NEAR testnet) for swapping tokens. To add support for multiple networks, the code needs to be refactored to allow for dynamic network selection based on runtime settings.
3. Feature

### Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
1. WalletProvider not connecting to NEAR protocol
   - Cause: Missing NEAR wallet credentials in runtime settings
   - Solution: Ensure NEAR wallet secret key and public key are properly configured in runtime settings

### Debugging Tips
- Check if NEAR wallet credentials are correctly provided in the runtime settings
- Verify that the network ID, node URL, and wallet URL are appropriately set for NEAR connection

### FAQ
Q: How can I validate NEAR configuration in the runtime settings?
A: You can use the `validateNearConfig` function with the `IAgentRuntime` object to validate the NEAR configuration based on the provided settings. Make sure to handle any `z.ZodError` exceptions that may occur.
