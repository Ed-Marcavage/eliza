## Features

### Actions
### swap
Perform a token swap using Ref Finance.

#### Properties
- Name: swap
- Similes: SWAP_TOKENS_NEAR, TOKEN_SWAP_NEAR, TRADE_TOKENS_NEAR, EXCHANGE_TOKENS_NEAR

#### Handler
This action executes a token swap using Ref Finance by estimating the swap route and sending the swap transactions.

#### Examples
- user: "{{user1}}"
- agent: "{{agent1}}"
- user: "{{user2}}"
- agent: "{{agent2}}"
- user: "{{user2}}"
- agent: "{{agent3}}"

### transfer
Transfer NEAR tokens to another account

#### Properties
- Name: transfer
- Similes: ['TRANSFER_NEAR', 'SEND_TOKENS', 'TRANSFER_TOKENS', 'PAY_NEAR']

#### Handler
The handler function for this action executes a NEAR token transfer to the specified recipient account. It extracts the recipient address, amount to transfer, and optional token contract address (for non-native NEAR transfers) from the user request and initiates the transfer. It then provides a response with the transfer details or an error message if the transfer fails.

#### Examples
- user: "Send 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet"
- agent: "I'll send 1.5 NEAR now..."
- user: "Successfully sent 1.5 NEAR to bob.testnet\nTransaction: ABC123XYZ"



### Providers
### Wallet Provider
This provider interacts with the NEAR Protocol blockchain to fetch wallet information and generate a formatted portfolio report.

#### Methods
Focus on the get() method and its functionality.

#### Usage
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime, Memory, Provider, State } from "@elizaos/core";
import { walletProvider } from "./providers/wallet";

const accountId = "your_near_address_here";
const runtime: IAgentRuntime = // initialize your runtime object

walletProvider.get(runtime, null, null)
    .then((portfolioReport) => {
        console.log(portfolioReport);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error fetching wallet information:", error);
    });
```



### Evaluators
No evaluators documentation available.

## Usage Examples
### providers/wallet.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Fetching the current value of a wallet portfolio and formatting it for display:
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider();
const runtime = getAgentRuntime();
const formattedPortfolio = await walletProvider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
console.log(formattedPortfolio);
```

2. Connecting to NEAR Protocol using the wallet provider:
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider();
const runtime = getAgentRuntime();
const account = await walletProvider.connect(runtime);
console.log(account);
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure NEAR wallet credentials are correctly configured before connecting to NEAR Protocol.
- Handle errors appropriately when fetching data from external APIs to prevent application crashes.

### actions/transfer.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. **Transfer NEAR tokens to a recipient:** This code can be used to transfer a specified amount of NEAR tokens to a recipient.
    ```javascript
    const recipient = "example.recipient";
    const amount = "10";
    const transactionHash = await transferNEAR(runtime, recipient, amount);
    console.log(transactionHash);
    ```

2. **Check if content is of type TransferContent:** This code can be used to determine if the provided content is of type TransferContent.
    ```javascript
    const content = {
        recipient: "example.recipient",
        amount: "20"
    };
    const isTransfer = isTransferContent(runtime, content);
    console.log(isTransfer);
    ```

### Best Practices
- **Validate content before transfer:** Always ensure that the content passed to the transfer function is of the proper type (TransferContent) to avoid errors during the transfer process.
- **Handle errors appropriately:** In case of errors such as missing NEAR wallet credentials, handle them gracefully by catching and handling the exceptions appropriately to provide a better user experience.

### environment.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Retrieving configuration object based on environment:
```typescript
import { getConfig } from './environment';

const environment = 'production';
const config = getConfig(environment);
console.log(config); // Output: Configuration object for production environment
```

2. Validating NEAR configuration:
```typescript
import { validateNearConfig } from './environment';
import { IAgentRuntime } from 'runtime';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime = // Define runtime
validateNearConfig(runtime)
  .then((nearConfig) => {
    console.log(nearConfig); // Output: Validated NearConfig object
  });
```

### Best Practices
- Use the `getConfig` function to easily retrieve the configuration object based on different environments.
- Ensure to pass the correct runtime object when validating NEAR configuration using the `validateNearConfig` function.

### actions/swap.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Checking storage balance before performing a token swap:
```typescript
const account = "alice";
const contractId = "tokenContract";
const hasStorageBalance = await checkStorageBalance(account, contractId);
if (hasStorageBalance) {
    console.log("Account has non-zero storage balance.");
} else {
    console.log("Account has zero storage balance.");
}
```

2. Performing a token swap transaction with specified input and output tokens:
```typescript
const runtime = new AgentRuntime();
const inputTokenId = "tokenA";
const outputTokenId = "tokenB";
const amount = "10";
const slippageTolerance = 0.02;
const swapTransactions = await swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance);
console.log("Token swap transactions:", swapTransactions);
```

### Best Practices
- Always handle the asynchronous nature of the functions by using `await` with `Promise` returns.
- Ensure that the input parameters provided to the functions are valid and of the correct type to avoid errors.

    // Implementation logic for supporting multiple networks
   - Type: feature

### Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
1. Wallet credentials not configured
   - Cause: NEAR wallet credentials (NEAR_WALLET_SECRET_KEY and NEAR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY) are not set in the runtime.
   - Solution: Set the NEAR wallet credentials in the agent's settings.

### Debugging Tips
- Make sure NEAR wallet credentials are correctly set in the agent's settings.
- Check network configuration and ensure that the NEAR network settings are correct.

### FAQ
Q: How to fetch the current NEAR price from the Coingecko API?
A: You can use the `fetchNearPrice()` method to fetch the current NEAR price, which will handle the API request and caching of the price for future use.
