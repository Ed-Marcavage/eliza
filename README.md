### providers/wallet.ts

# providers/wallet.ts Usage Documentation

## Purpose
The file `providers/wallet.ts` contains classes and interfaces related to managing a wallet provider. This includes connecting to a NEAR wallet, fetching portfolio information, and formatting portfolio data for display.

## Components
### Classes
- `WalletProvider`: Represents a Wallet Provider that implements the `Provider` interface.

### Methods
- `constructor`: Creates an instance of the `WalletProvider` class.
- `get`: Retrieves the formatted portfolio from the wallet provider.
- `connect`: Connects to the NEAR wallet and sets up authentication.
- `fetchWithRetry`: Fetches data from a URL with retries in case of errors.
- `fetchPortfolioValue`: Fetches the portfolio value for the account associated.
- `fetchNearPrice`: Fetches and returns the near price from the API endpoint.
- `formatPortfolio`: Formats the portfolio information into a readable string.
- `getFormattedPortfolio`: Fetches the portfolio value and formats it into a string.

### Interfaces
- `NearToken`: Represents a Near Protocol token with specific properties.
- `WalletPortfolio`: Represents a wallet portfolio with total values and token information.

## Common Use Cases
1. **Connecting to the NEAR wallet and fetching portfolio information:**
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider(accountId);
const runtime = { secret: 'my-secret-key', publicKey: 'my-public-key' };
const formattedPortfolio = await walletProvider.getFormattedPortfolio(runtime);
console.log(formattedPortfolio);
```

2. **Fetching portfolio value utilizing caching mechanism:**
```typescript
const walletProvider = new WalletProvider(accountId);
const runtime = { secret: 'my-secret-key', publicKey: 'my-public-key' };
const portfolioValue = await walletProvider.fetchPortfolioValue(runtime);
console.log(portfolioValue);
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure NEAR wallet credentials are properly configured before connecting.
- Handle errors in fetch calls gracefully and consider using retry logic.
- Utilize caching mechanisms for efficient data retrieval.
- Follow the interface definitions for NearToken and WalletPortfolio when working with token and portfolio data.

### actions/transfer.ts

# File: actions/transfer.ts

## Purpose
This file contains interfaces and functions related to transferring tokens, specifically NEAR tokens. The `TransferContent` interface defines the content structure of a transfer, and the `isTransferContent` function checks if the provided content is a valid TransferContent object. The `transferNEAR` function allows for the transfer of NEAR tokens to a specified recipient.

## Common Use Cases
### Checking TransferContent
```typescript
import { isTransferContent } from './actions/transfer';
import { TransferContent } from './interfaces';

const content: TransferContent = {
  recipient: 'recipient.near',
  amount: '10',
  tokenAddress: null
};

const isTransfer = isTransferContent(runtime, content);
console.log(isTransfer); // Output: true
```

### Transferring NEAR Tokens
```typescript
import { transferNEAR } from './actions/transfer';
import { IAgentRuntime } from './runtime/interfaces';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime = new Runtime();
const recipient = 'recipient.near';
const amount = '10';

try {
  const txHash = await transferNEAR(runtime, recipient, amount);
  console.log(`Transfer successful. Transaction hash: ${txHash}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure the `content` object passed to `isTransferContent` matches the `TransferContent` interface to avoid errors.
- Always handle errors thrown by the `transferNEAR` function to provide appropriate feedback to users.
- Securely manage NEAR wallet credentials to prevent unauthorized transfers.
- Verify recipient and amount values before initiating a transfer to prevent mistakes.

### environment.ts

# environment.ts

## Purpose
The `environment.ts` file contains type definitions and functions related to the configuration of the NEAR Environment. It provides a way to retrieve and validate the NEAR configuration for different environments.

## Components

### Types
#### NearConfig
Type definition for the configuration of NEAR Environment. It includes properties like `networkId`, `nodeUrl`, `walletUrl`, `WRAP_NEAR_CONTRACT_ID`, `REF_FI_CONTRACT_ID`, `REF_TOKEN_ID`, `indexerUrl`, `explorerUrl`, and `REF_DCL_SWAP_CONTRACT_ID`.

### Functions
#### getConfig
Retrieves the configuration based on the specified environment or uses default values if not provided.
```typescript
/**
* Retrieves the configuration based on the specified environment or uses default values if not provided.
* 
* @param {string | undefined | null} env - The environment to retrieve the configuration for.
* @returns {Object} The configuration object containing networkId, nodeUrl, walletUrl, WRAP_NEAR_CONTRACT_ID, REF_FI_CONTRACT_ID,
* REF_TOKEN_ID, indexerUrl, explorerUrl, and REF_DCL_SWAP_CONTRACT_ID based on the specified environment. If no valid environment is provided,
* default values for the mainnet environment are returned.
*/
```

#### validateNearConfig
Validates the NEAR configuration based on the provided runtime and environment variables.
```typescript
/**
* Validates the NEAR configuration based on the provided runtime and environment variables.
* @param {IAgentRuntime} runtime - The Agent Runtime interface.
* @returns {Promise<NearConfig>} - A Promise that resolves to a valid NearConfig object.
*/
```

## Common Use Cases
1. Retrieve configuration for the mainnet environment:
```typescript
const config = getConfig();
console.log(config);
```

2. Validate NEAR configuration using Agent Runtime:
```typescript
const runtime = getAgentRuntime();
validateNearConfig(runtime)
    .then((config) => {
        console.log("Valid NEAR configuration:", config);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error validating NEAR configuration:", error);
    });
```

## Best Practices
- Always provide a valid environment parameter when calling `getConfig` to get the specific configuration.
- Use `validateNearConfig` to ensure the NEAR configuration is valid before using it in your application.
- Handle promise rejections when using `validateNearConfig` to catch any validation errors.

### actions/swap.ts

# actions/swap.ts

## Purpose
The `actions/swap.ts` file contains functions related to swapping tokens. The `checkStorageBalance` function is used to check the storage balance for a specific account within a contract, while the `swapToken` function is used to perform token swaps with the provided input and output tokens, amount, and slippage tolerance.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Checking Storage Balance
```typescript
const account = '0x123abc';
const contractId = 'contract123';

const hasBalance = await checkStorageBalance(account, contractId);
if (hasBalance) {
    console.log('Storage balance is not null and total is not "0"');
} else {
    console.log('Storage balance is either null or total is "0"');
}
```

### 2. Token Swap
```typescript
const runtime = new AgentRuntime();
const inputTokenId = 'token1';
const outputTokenId = 'token2';
const amount = '100';
const slippageTolerance = 0.02;

const transactions = await swapToken(runtime, inputTokenId, outputTokenId, amount, slippageTolerance);
console.log('Swap transactions:', transactions);
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the account and contract ID are valid when using the `checkStorageBalance` function.
- Before performing a token swap, make sure to provide accurate input token ID, output token ID, amount, and slippage tolerance to the `swapToken` function.
- Handle the Promise returned by `swapToken` function appropriately, as it resolves to an array of transactions representing the swap process.
- Consider adjusting the slippage tolerance parameter based on the specific requirements of the swap operation.

## Common issues and their solutions
1. **Issue**: Missing package dependencies causing module import errors.
   **Solution**: Check package.json for correct dependencies and run `npm install` to install missing packages.

2. **Issue**: Errors in error handling methods like `connect` or `fetchPortfolioValue`.
   **Solution**: Double-check the error handling logic in the methods and ensure proper error throwing and catching mechanisms are in place.

## Error messages and their meanings
1. **Error Message**: `Error: NEAR wallet credentials are not properly configured.`
   **Meaning**: The NEAR wallet credentials in the runtime object are incorrect or missing.
   
2. **Error Message**: `Error: Failed to fetch portfolio value.`
   **Meaning**: A problem occurred while fetching or processing the portfolio value.

## Debugging tips
- Use `console.log()` statements to track the flow of execution and identify where errors occur.
- Utilize `try/catch` blocks to catch and handle errors more effectively.

## Configuration problems
- Ensure that the NEAR wallet credentials are correctly configured in the runtime object.
